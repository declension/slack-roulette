Slack Roulette
==============

What?
-----

It's a Serverless Slack bot for organising chat-roulette style one-to-one interactions.

 
Why?
----
 
As many of use move to remote-only working,
the need for human interaction is amplified.

Video chats are a good substitute for water-cooler chats, coffee breaks, lunches outside the office.

One-to-one chats in particular encourage a deeper connection between colleagues who might not often chat.


How?
----

Using
 * Chalice from AWS
 * the official Python 3 client for Slack
 * AWS SSM via `boto3`
 * AWS Lambda (and API Gateway) for serverless hosting
 * Some other stuff


What next?
----------

 * Make it work!
 * Persist the shuffle in
